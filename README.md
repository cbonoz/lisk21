## LiskCollectible

Turn any collection of files into a sellable NFT backed by Lisk.

## Inspiration

There's been a lot of discussion around the value of NFT's and collecting/speculation purposes, but much less regarding NFTs for use in legal or digital content ownership.

For any new product, the associated intellectual property will often have been touched by many actors: founders; employees; contractors; educational institutions; government funding agencies; third party licensors of technology and IP rights; and customers, including those involved in beta testing and pre-launch activities. For each of these actors, there should be written agreements in place to cover moral rights, retention of rights to background technology, any restrictions on exploiting the IP, and the scope of the licenses that are granted. In addition, joint ownership creates special challenges.

For written or digital media, it can be difficult to prove the ownership of a particular idea. With LiskCollectible, an NFT can be generated at a particular point in time wrapping a collection of documents or media - whoever owns the NFT can demonstrate proof of ownership over such content.
